******************************************/

// Add variables that store DOM elements you will need to reference and/or manipulate



// Create a function to hide all of the items in the list excpet for the ten you want to show
// Tip: Keep in mind that with a list of 54 studetns, the last page will only display four




// Create and append the pagination links - Creating a function that can do this is a good approach




// Add functionality to the pagination buttons so that they show and hide the correct items
// Tip: If you created a function above to show/hide list items, it could be helpful here
